# My Profile Website 

AI-generated website created for **Introduction to DevOps**.  
This repository demonstrates the use of Git for version control and GitHub for publishing a website.

---

## Purpose of the Repository

The purpose of this repository is to practice and demonstrate:

- Using **Git** to track changes to a project  
- Publishing code to a **public GitHub repository**  
- Understanding a basic **DevOps-style workflow** from local development to deployment  

This website was generated using AI tools and then managed, committed, and deployed using Git and GitHub.

### Git Setup and Workflow Steps
The following steps were taken to set up Git and push the project to GitHub:

1. Created a new local project directory for the website.
2. Initialized Git in the project using `git init`.
3. Added website files (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) to the repository.
4. Staged changes using `git add .`.
5. Committed the files with clear and descriptive commit messages.
6. Created a public GitHub repository.
7. Connected the local repository to GitHub using `git remote add origin`.
8. Pushed the code to the main branch using `git push`.
9. Edited and maintained the README.md file directly in GitHub.
10. (Optional) Enabled GitHub Pages to host the website.

### Challenges and Solutions
One challenge was understanding how GitHub renders Markdown files and how commits work directly in the browser versus locally.  
This was resolved by using GitHub’s Preview feature before committing changes and reviewing commit history to confirm updates were applied correctly.
